<br />
但不管怎麽说，他是不是同性恋，不是问题，但如果涉嫌恋童，那可就一定是问题了。我在《五错俱全的王丹》一文里曾提到，王丹在哈佛读书期间，他的美国邻居就有反映，王丹和太多男孩子交往，如果不当接触未成年男孩的话，是会犯罪的，需要长辈管教。在台湾清华大学，也有老师意识到他周围总有一些年轻男孩。学校老师们还以为，王丹是因为安全原因，需要有一帮男孩子保护。当被告知王丹的美国邻居的担忧时，清大老师才意识到，原来还有这种“思路”。 <br />
<br />
几个月前前，有人给我提供了一篇和这种思路相吻合的有关王丹的英文文章（附在本文后），并告知，有一个外人不懂的世界――成年男人装小孩，逗小狗小猫，为的是吸引小孩，那是“恋童癖”表现的一种。<br />
<br />
这篇英文文章的大致内容是，王丹离开哈佛后，把他的一些私人物品寄存在一个仓库里，但由于他的代理人（也就是哈佛大学东亚所那个帮王丹写英文作业的南希女士）没有及时缴费，他的东西被清仓拍卖，结果被发现其中有“裸体男孩照片”，最后那些男孩裸照都被美国FBI高价收回。这件事情的过程恰好被一个喜欢购买拍卖品的美国人撞见，所以他写出了这个过程。从该文语调来看，他显然对中国天安门学生领袖私藏儿童裸照的行为很厌恶、很不满，所以他的文章标题是（No Child Porn Here）, 意是是∶别在这里搞儿童色情。<br />
<br />
几年前我从美国的一个电视新闻报道中得知∶私藏儿童的裸体照片是犯法的，从网上下载儿童裸体照片到自己的电脑里也犯法，如果发送传播，刑罚就更严重。电视片中那个尚没有任何侵犯儿童的行为、只是从网上下载了儿童裸照的人，直接就被警察铐走了。报道提示，如周围邻居有此类问题，要向警察局报备，以保护附近的儿童。<br />
<br />
这篇英文在我这里已经压了好几个月了，一直期待王丹能像个公众人物的样子，诚恳地对待批评，对他撒的一串谎言道个歉，对被指控的款项问题做个交代，那我就替他保住这个密――起码不从我这儿捅出去。但他不仅毫无悔意，而是更加嚣张；甚者故意给骗子韩寒背书，并再一次想靠舆论帮他要特权。既然他狂妄到对所有的批评都置之不理，那我也就完全没必要把这个信息帮他藏在文件夹的深层。更何况，他可能根本不把涉嫌“儿童色情”当回事儿（连美国FBI不也只是存档备案，并没抓他吗，六四光环还是相当有保护层的），就像他的同行者，前中国民联主席、《北京之春》主编胡平，收了中共领馆一铺子香烟，把我吓出一身冷汗，当成天大的事儿，但人家就像没事人一样，继续潇洒地指点民运江山（还继续收中领馆的厚礼？）。以王丹对前面一系列事情的处理来看，他和胡平的确是同志，活在一个外人不懂得的世界。所以，本文只是给大众读者看的，看看这样的人是否适合做role model（年轻人的样板）。<br />
<br />
我得到这篇文章的时候，用链接一下子就连到了网上的原文，但是去年底，这篇文章就从网上神秘地消失了（受到了来自哪里的压力？）。<br />
<br />
好在现在是网络时代，凡是网上有过的东西，就像凡是在电脑打过的东西，哪怕全部删除掉了，在专家那里也都是可以查到的。请看附录的这篇文章，以及链接的网络存档版（请往下看，到 No Child Porn Here）。我只是作为一个记者提供这个信息，至于应该怎样看待这件事情，我就不再评论，由读者自己来判断吧。<br />

No Child Porn Here <br />
<br />
by Alden Howes Olson <br />

22 February 2013<br />
<br />
This really happened.  Totally no shit.  I used to go to a lot of auctions, two or three a week, sometimes four or five.  One of my favorite auctions was Acorn Auctions, run by Stan (name changed).  Stan was terrific and he almost always had interesting items, never much high end, expensive stuff, but interesting stuff.  Stuff you could either use or re-sell.  I hit Acorn every Saturday afternoon to preview as early as possible, then go home to look up online the items I was interested in.  Everything Stan sold was his.  He bought virtually all of it at storage unit auctions, way before Storage Wars got on TV. <br />
<br />
So one Saturday afternoon I go into the place and, because I’m always there early, only Stan is there, no one else has been in yet.  I start previewing on the left side of the room, like usual, and immediately see that this auction is totally different from all the others I’ve seen Stan hold.  <br />
<br />
The first table is full of pictures of crowds of Chinese people and some Chinese soldiers.  Hundreds of pictures.  This is not a happy occasion.  I pick up one photo that shows a guy with no forehead.  The cavity behind the hole is empty, no brains, nothing inside his skull.  Some blood on his face, his chin on the street.  I look at other photos that show some tanks, some people running, some look like they’re throwing rocks, some injured.  The crowds are huge, chaotic.  This is no small event.  <br />
<br />
On the next table a little print-out by Stan says the items belonged to Wang Dan, a leader of the Tienanmen Square uprising in 1989.  There are what look like old notebooks or journals.  No idea what they say because I don’t read Chinese.  Could be anything, but naturally you think they are journals kept as a record of the demonstrations.  It was a big deal at the time.  Wang Dan was more or less second-in-command.  He was very present, very outspoken.  The Chinese government hated him.  And arrested him.  Put him in jail.  Eventually, he was released.  Then he got jailed again.  This time Bill Clinton, at a summit meeting in China, requested that the People’s Republic of China release Dan, who would come to the U.S.  In fact, he would become a graduate student at Harvard.  <br />
<br />
I notice on the floor about a dozen boxes filled with New Yorker magazines.  I look at the address labels - all the same address.  Wang Dan; c/o Nancy Hearst; Librarian; Fairbank Center; Harvard University; Cambridge MA.  I write this down.  <br />
<br />
I continue through the rest of the room.  Some stuff is normal, but more of the items are clearly part of Wang Dan’s stuff.  I know it must all have come from a storage unit.  I ask Stan about it.  He says he got it at a storage unit in Somerville a few days ago.  <br />
<br />
I say thanks and leave, go home, and call the Fairbank Center.  No answer.  I leave a message. I try directory assistance and find a Nancy Hearst in Brookline and call her house.  No answer.  I leave a message.  She calls back.  I tell her I’m not an expert, but this looks like historically significant stuff for sale tonight in Greenfield.  Is she aware that Wang Dan’s stuff is being auctioned off?  No, she says, Dan has been traveling around the world speaking out for democracy in China and it was her responsibility to pay his storage unit rent.  Which she neglected to do.  So his stuff was sold to Stan and now would be sold to anyone with enough money to win the bidding.  I told her I didn’t have a lot of money, but I would be glad to buy the most important items and get them back to Dan as long as I could get reimbursed.  She said maybe, that she would call Wang Dan, and would I please call her back in about 10 minutes.  I called back.  No answer.  I waited another 10 minutes and called back.  No answer.  I did this twice more.  She wasn’t picking up.  <br />
<br />
So after an hour of trying to contact Hearst, and with the auction about to begin, I drove back down and saw the stuff sold.  I didn’t buy any of it.  A local book dealer bought the diaries for about $7000 dollars plus 10 percent commission.  $7700 and he couldn’t even read them or know for sure what they were about.  <br />
<br />
Monday afternoon I stop by Acorn to see Stan about something.  He tells me he had some visitors that morning.  The FBI had stopped in.  They got a list of all the people who bought Wang Dan’s stuff and went to all of them and bought it all back.  They paid the buyers more money than was bid.  Everyone made some kind of profit, but probably not the amount they were hoping for.  <br />
<br />
Stan tells me there were also some pictures of naked boys he found in the unit.  Young naked boys.  Not good.  At first he thought he had thrown them out with the rest of the  trash that inevitably comes with a storage unit purchase, but wasn’t really sure.  Turns out he still had them in the backroom along with a few other things in a some beer flats, which he was going to toss but then the FBI showed up.  The FBI agent asked Stan how much he thought he could sell the stuff in the beer flats for.  Stan, thinking quickly, said it was worth about $1000.  So the agent paid him a grand on the spot and took all the stuff that Stan was going to toss, including the porn.<br />
<br />
Later Monday afternoon I’m home and Nancy Hearst calls me.  She is a little tense.  She wants to know whether I bought anything at the auction and who else bought stuff.  She asks her questions slowly, unlike when I talked with her a couple of days earlier.  She keeps pausing between sentences as if someone else is in the room with her.  I tell her I don’t know who bought what, but I didn’t buy any of it because she didn’t answer her phone.  She told me she didn’t pick up because she was afraid I might be from the Chinese embassy.  Of course.  <br />
<br />
Totally no shit here.  True story.  The FBI told Stan they were buying all Wang Dan’s stuff back as a matter of national security.  Considering that Dan was one big, huge thorn in the side of the Chinese government and that he was the darling of the American pro-life crowd, and the politically conservative crowd, and a bunch of other crowds that hated PRC, and that no less than President Bill Clinton secured his release from Chinese jail and that Harvard had gladly taken him in, I’d guess Wang Dan’s photographs were kind of an embarrassment that the U.S. government wanted to forget about. Forever. <br />
