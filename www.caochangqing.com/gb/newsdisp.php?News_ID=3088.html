</center>在彭丽媛随丈夫出访风光之际，美联社发表报导并重新刊登1989年中共血腥镇压天安门学生时，彭丽媛身&#30528;军装，去慰问戒严部队并献演的照片。提醒世人，她是镇压中国人、杀害孩子的解放军的一员。<br />
<br />
美联社的报导说，彭丽媛在六四屠杀时，穿&#30528;解放军军服，头发扎成马尾巴，对头带钢盔、手持冲锋枪、列队在天安门广场的戒严部队军人演唱慰问，和今天她跟丈夫、中国国家主席习近平出访那身现代的打扮、时髦的发型形成很大反差。<br />
<br />
美联社引述维吉尼亚州阿灵顿“2049民主项目研究所”的中国人权研究专家凯利.克瑞（Kelley Currie）的评论∶“看到习近平带&#30528;歌星太太出访，很多人感觉中国可能有了新型国家领导人，但我认为，这些新形象却提醒人们，这还是原来那个党，只不过使用一些新的手法，来达到原有目的∶巩固他们自己的权力。”<br />
<br />
美联社的报导说，“彭丽媛热”伴随著中国官方媒体的热捧，中共报纸大标题是，彭丽媛让世界看到中国的美丽。美联社分析说，这是中共官方用这种方式（肯定赞美习近平夫人）来巩固习近平刚获得的政治权力。<br />
<br />
美联社说，今年50岁的彭丽媛是中国解放军少将，虽然她主要是演唱，但她的经历是在军队，18岁就参加解放军。这张她当年在天安门广场为刚刚用坦克、冲锋枪血腥屠杀了和平请愿的学生和市民的中共官兵演唱照片，发表在当年的中共军方刊物上。澳大利亚莫纳什大学（Monash University）的中国军事历史专家、来自台湾的学者孙万国（Warren Sun）说，他毫不怀疑这张照片的真实性，并引述1992年的一份学术报告说，六四屠杀后，彭丽媛慰问屠杀部队的演唱歌曲是“最可爱的人”，向戒严部队致敬。<br />
<br />
美联社的报导还提到，2007年时，彭丽媛还曾在身&#30528;藏人服装的歌唱队伴舞下，演唱赞美1959年在西藏屠杀的解放军（当年达赖喇嘛率8万藏民逃离西藏、进入印度流亡，至今半个多世纪都无法回到西藏家园），呼喊“谁来解放我们，亲爱的解放军！”这段录像引起西藏人权组织的严厉批评。<br />
<br />
美联社的报导说，彭丽媛在六四屠杀时慰问戒严部队的照片，刚在网络上流传，就遭到中共当局封锁。有专家说，这张照片产生的冲击力，可能主要在海外，而不是中国国内。意思是，中国老百姓看不到。而且由于中共控制新闻，封锁历史真相，很多中国二十多岁的年轻人，根本不知道六四屠杀这回事，更别说真相。美联社的报导说，当年六四屠杀，有几百名，甚至几千名中国人遇难。被彭丽媛所属、所献唱赞美的戒严部队杀害。<br />
<br />
海外华人主办的《右派网》也转载了美联社关於中共封杀彭丽媛在六四屠杀后慰问解放军的照片。<br />

China’s first lady serenaded Tiananmen troops <br />
<br />
By GILLIAN WONG <br />
<br />
Associated Press Mar 28, 2013<br />
<br />
BEIJING (AP) -- A photo of China’s new first lady Peng Liyuan in younger days, singing to martial-law troops following the 1989 bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, flickered across Chinese cyberspace this week.<br />
<br />
It was swiftly scrubbed from China’s Internet before it could generate discussion online. But the image - seen and shared by outside observers - revived a memory the leadership prefers to suppress and shows one of the challenges in presenting Peng on the world stage as the softer side of China.<br />
<br />
The country has no recent precedent for the role of first lady, and also faces a tricky balance at home. The leadership wants Peng to show the human side of the new No. 1 leader, Xi Jinping, while not exposing too many perks of the elite. And it must balance popular support for the first couple with an acute wariness of personality cults that could skew the consensus rule among the Chinese Communist Party’s top leaders.<br />
<br />
The image of Peng in a green military uniform, her windswept hair tied back in a ponytail as she sings to helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, contrasts with her appearances this week in trendy suits and coiffed hair while touring Russia and Africa with Xi, waving to her enthusiastic hosts.<br />
<br />
"I think that we have a lot of people hoping that because Xi Jinping walks around without a tie on and his wife is a singer who travels with him on trips that maybe we’re dealing with a new kind of leader, but I think these images remind people that this is the same party," said Kelley Currie, a China human rights expert for the pro-democracy Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia.<br />
<br />
"It’s using some new tools and new techniques, for the same purposes: to preserve its own power."<br />
<br />
Peng, 50, a major general in the People’s Liberation Army who is best known for soaring renditions of patriotic odes to the military and the party, kept a low profile in recent years as her husband prepared to take over as Communist Party chief. Her re-emergence has been accompanied by a blitz in domestic, state-run media hailing her beauty and charm, in a bid to harness the singer’s popularity to build support for Xi at home and abroad.<br />
<br />
"Peng Liyuan: Let the world appreciate the beauty of China," declared the headline of a China News Service commentary that said the first lady’s elegant manners, conversation and clothing would highlight Chinese culture. Her presence on diplomatic trips would demystify the first family for the Chinese public, the commentary said.<br />
<br />
However, the government is stepping into little-charted and possibly treacherous waters for China.<br />
<br />
In 1963, the glamorous Wang Guangmei, wife of President Liu Shaoqi, wore a tightfitting qipao dress to a state banquet in Indonesia. When the political tides turned against Liu four years later, radical Red Guards forced Wang to don the same dress and paraded her through the streets as a shameful example of capitalist corruption.<br />
<br />
Revolutionary leader Mao Zedong’s wife, Jiang Qing, played a key role in the same radical campaign in which political opponents were mercilessly persecuted; after his death, she was put on trial and imprisoned, then moved to a hospital where she hanged herself.<br />
<br />
The lifespan of Peng’s Tiananmen image in the finicky world of the Chinese Internet has so far been short, and she remains a beloved household name with huge domestic popularity. The photo has circulated mainly on Twitter, which is blocked in China. The few posts on popular domestic microblogs did not evade censors for long.<br />
<br />
Many young Chinese are unaware that on June 3 and 4, 1989, military troops crushed weekslong pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing with force, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, of people. Those who do know about the assault tend to be understanding of Peng’s obligations as a member of a performance troupe in the all-powerful People’s Liberation Army. At the time, her husband Xi was party chief of an eastern city.<br />
<br />
"The photo probably has a negative impact more so internationally than domestically," said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at City University of Hong Kong. He said more scrutiny of Peng is likely and such images could raise questions about Xi’s interest in reforms.<br />
<br />
"It has been several months now that Xi Jinping has assumed the top leadership role and certainly, we have found no indicator that he is interested in this stage to push serious political reform."<br />
<br />
The image is a snapshot of the back cover of a 1989 issue of a publicly available military magazine, the PLA Pictorial, according to Sun Li, a Chinese reporter who said he had taken a photo of it on his cell phone several years ago when it was inadvertently posted on his microblog. Sun said he quickly deleted it and had no idea how it resurfaced on the Internet years later.<br />
<br />
Microblog users can easily save images and recirculate them even after the original posts have been deleted. The picture spread further after it was tweeted by the U.S.-based China Digital Times, which tracks Chinese online media.<br />
<br />
Warren Sun, a Chinese military historian at Monash University in Australia, said he had little doubt about the authenticity of the image, citing a 1992 academic report as saying that after the crackdown, Peng performed a song titled "The Most Beloved People" in a salute to martial law troops.<br />
<br />
While most of her army career has been in singing, the militaristic overtones of many of Peng’s public appearances set her apart from Michelle Obama, former French first lady Carla Bruni and most of their counterparts in other countries. But for Peng, the Tiananmen photo was no one-off: She has been in the military since age 18 and has fronted TV music videos featuring dancing lines of men with combat fatigues and heavy weaponry.<br />
<br />
She also starred in a song-and-dance number in 2007 that has perky women in Tibetan garb sashaying behind her while she sings an ode to the army that invaded Tibet in 1959. "Who is going to liberate us? It’s the dear PLA!" go some of the lyrics. The video has provoked severe criticism from Tibetan rights groups.<br />
<br />
In an indication of Peng’s appeal in China despite her past, a man whose 19-year-old son was killed in the Tiananmen crackdown said he bears no grudges against her.<br />
<br />
"If I had known about this back then, I would have been very disgusted by it. But now, looking at it objectively, it’s all in the past," said Wang Fandi, whose son Wang Nan died from a bullet wound to his head. "She was in the establishment. If the military wanted her to perform, she had to go. What else could she do?"<br />
<br />
Wang was a teacher at the China Conservatory of Music when Peng had been sent there by the military to study singing in her 20s. Though he never taught her directly, Wang had known who she was and describes her as being modest, a talented folk singer and an outstanding student.<br />
<br />
"When I look back at history, I will look at it from other perspectives," Wang said. "Even if she had done something wrong, we shouldn’t make a fuss about it. What’s important is what happens in the future."<br><br>2013-03-28<br><br>http://www.caochangqing.com  （转载请指明出处）</td></tr><tr><td align=left><br>
