</center>在彭麗媛隨丈夫出訪風光之際，美聯社發表報導並重新刊登1989年中共血腥鎮壓天安門學生時，彭麗媛身&#30528;軍裝，去慰問戒嚴部隊並獻演的照片。提醒世人，她是鎮壓中國人、殺害孩子的解放軍的一員。<br />
<br />
美聯社的報導說，彭麗媛在六四屠殺時，穿&#30528;解放軍軍服，頭髮扎成馬尾巴，對頭帶鋼盔、手持衝鋒槍、列隊在天安門廣場的戒嚴部隊軍人演唱慰問，和今天她跟丈夫、中國國家主席習近平出訪那身現代的打扮、時髦的髮型形成很大反差。<br />
<br />
美聯社引述維吉尼亞州阿靈頓“2049民主項目研究所”的中國人權研究專家凱利.克瑞（Kelley Currie）的評論：“看到習近平帶&#30528;歌星太太出訪，很多人感覺中國可能有了新型國家領導人，但我認為，這些新形象卻提醒人們，這還是原來那個黨，只不過使用一些新的手法，來達到原有目的：鞏固他們自己的權力。”<br />
<br />
美聯社的報導說，“彭麗媛熱”伴隨著中國官方媒體的熱捧，中共報紙大標題是，彭麗媛讓世界看到中國的美麗。美聯社分析說，這是中共官方用這種方式（肯定讚美習近平夫人）來鞏固習近平剛獲得的政治權力。<br />
<br />
美聯社說，今年50歲的彭麗媛是中國解放軍少將，雖然她主要是演唱，但她的經歷是在軍隊，18歲就參加解放軍。這張她當年在天安門廣場為剛剛用坦克、衝鋒槍血腥屠殺了和平請願的學生和市民的中共官兵演唱照片，發表在當年的中共軍方刊物上。澳大利亞莫納什大學（Monash University）的中國軍事歷史專家、來自台灣的學者孫萬國（Warren Sun）說，他毫不懷疑這張照片的真實性，並引述1992年的一份學術報告說，六四屠殺后，彭麗媛慰問屠殺部隊的演唱歌曲是“最可愛的人”，向戒嚴部隊致敬。<br />
<br />
美聯社的報導還提到，2007年時，彭麗媛還曾在身&#30528;藏人服裝的歌唱隊伴舞下，演唱讚美1959年在西藏屠殺的解放軍（當年達賴喇嘛率8萬藏民逃離西藏、進入印度流亡，至今半個多世紀都無法回到西藏家園），呼喊“誰來解放我們，親愛的解放軍！”這段錄像引起西藏人權組織的嚴厲批評。<br />
<br />
美聯社的報導說，彭麗媛在六四屠殺時慰問戒嚴部隊的照片，剛在網絡上流傳，就遭到中共當局封鎖。有專家說，這張照片產生的衝擊力，可能主要在海外，而不是中國國內。意思是，中國老百姓看不到。而且由于中共控制新聞，封鎖歷史真相，很多中國二十多歲的年輕人，根本不知道六四屠殺這回事，更別說真相。美聯社的報導說，當年六四屠殺，有幾百名，甚至幾千名中國人遇難。被彭麗媛所屬、所獻唱讚美的戒嚴部隊殺害。<br />
<br />
海外華人主辦的《右派網》也轉載了美聯社關於中共封殺彭麗媛在六四屠殺后慰問解放軍的照片。<br />

China’s first lady serenaded Tiananmen troops <br />
<br />
By GILLIAN WONG <br />
<br />
Associated Press Mar 28, 2013<br />
<br />
BEIJING (AP) -- A photo of China’s new first lady Peng Liyuan in younger days, singing to martial-law troops following the 1989 bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, flickered across Chinese cyberspace this week.<br />
<br />
It was swiftly scrubbed from China’s Internet before it could generate discussion online. But the image - seen and shared by outside observers - revived a memory the leadership prefers to suppress and shows one of the challenges in presenting Peng on the world stage as the softer side of China.<br />
<br />
The country has no recent precedent for the role of first lady, and also faces a tricky balance at home. The leadership wants Peng to show the human side of the new No. 1 leader, Xi Jinping, while not exposing too many perks of the elite. And it must balance popular support for the first couple with an acute wariness of personality cults that could skew the consensus rule among the Chinese Communist Party’s top leaders.<br />
<br />
The image of Peng in a green military uniform, her windswept hair tied back in a ponytail as she sings to helmeted and rifle-bearing troops seated in rows on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, contrasts with her appearances this week in trendy suits and coiffed hair while touring Russia and Africa with Xi, waving to her enthusiastic hosts.<br />
<br />
"I think that we have a lot of people hoping that because Xi Jinping walks around without a tie on and his wife is a singer who travels with him on trips that maybe we’re dealing with a new kind of leader, but I think these images remind people that this is the same party," said Kelley Currie, a China human rights expert for the pro-democracy Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia.<br />
<br />
"It’s using some new tools and new techniques, for the same purposes: to preserve its own power."<br />
<br />
Peng, 50, a major general in the People’s Liberation Army who is best known for soaring renditions of patriotic odes to the military and the party, kept a low profile in recent years as her husband prepared to take over as Communist Party chief. Her re-emergence has been accompanied by a blitz in domestic, state-run media hailing her beauty and charm, in a bid to harness the singer’s popularity to build support for Xi at home and abroad.<br />
<br />
"Peng Liyuan: Let the world appreciate the beauty of China," declared the headline of a China News Service commentary that said the first lady’s elegant manners, conversation and clothing would highlight Chinese culture. Her presence on diplomatic trips would demystify the first family for the Chinese public, the commentary said.<br />
<br />
However, the government is stepping into little-charted and possibly treacherous waters for China.<br />
<br />
In 1963, the glamorous Wang Guangmei, wife of President Liu Shaoqi, wore a tightfitting qipao dress to a state banquet in Indonesia. When the political tides turned against Liu four years later, radical Red Guards forced Wang to don the same dress and paraded her through the streets as a shameful example of capitalist corruption.<br />
<br />
Revolutionary leader Mao Zedong’s wife, Jiang Qing, played a key role in the same radical campaign in which political opponents were mercilessly persecuted; after his death, she was put on trial and imprisoned, then moved to a hospital where she hanged herself.<br />
<br />
The lifespan of Peng’s Tiananmen image in the finicky world of the Chinese Internet has so far been short, and she remains a beloved household name with huge domestic popularity. The photo has circulated mainly on Twitter, which is blocked in China. The few posts on popular domestic microblogs did not evade censors for long.<br />
<br />
Many young Chinese are unaware that on June 3 and 4, 1989, military troops crushed weekslong pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing with force, killing hundreds, possibly thousands, of people. Those who do know about the assault tend to be understanding of Peng’s obligations as a member of a performance troupe in the all-powerful People’s Liberation Army. At the time, her husband Xi was party chief of an eastern city.<br />
<br />
"The photo probably has a negative impact more so internationally than domestically," said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist at City University of Hong Kong. He said more scrutiny of Peng is likely and such images could raise questions about Xi’s interest in reforms.<br />
<br />
"It has been several months now that Xi Jinping has assumed the top leadership role and certainly, we have found no indicator that he is interested in this stage to push serious political reform."<br />
<br />
The image is a snapshot of the back cover of a 1989 issue of a publicly available military magazine, the PLA Pictorial, according to Sun Li, a Chinese reporter who said he had taken a photo of it on his cell phone several years ago when it was inadvertently posted on his microblog. Sun said he quickly deleted it and had no idea how it resurfaced on the Internet years later.<br />
<br />
Microblog users can easily save images and recirculate them even after the original posts have been deleted. The picture spread further after it was tweeted by the U.S.-based China Digital Times, which tracks Chinese online media.<br />
<br />
Warren Sun, a Chinese military historian at Monash University in Australia, said he had little doubt about the authenticity of the image, citing a 1992 academic report as saying that after the crackdown, Peng performed a song titled "The Most Beloved People" in a salute to martial law troops.<br />
<br />
While most of her army career has been in singing, the militaristic overtones of many of Peng’s public appearances set her apart from Michelle Obama, former French first lady Carla Bruni and most of their counterparts in other countries. But for Peng, the Tiananmen photo was no one-off: She has been in the military since age 18 and has fronted TV music videos featuring dancing lines of men with combat fatigues and heavy weaponry.<br />
<br />
She also starred in a song-and-dance number in 2007 that has perky women in Tibetan garb sashaying behind her while she sings an ode to the army that invaded Tibet in 1959. "Who is going to liberate us? It’s the dear PLA!" go some of the lyrics. The video has provoked severe criticism from Tibetan rights groups.<br />
<br />
In an indication of Peng’s appeal in China despite her past, a man whose 19-year-old son was killed in the Tiananmen crackdown said he bears no grudges against her.<br />
<br />
"If I had known about this back then, I would have been very disgusted by it. But now, looking at it objectively, it’s all in the past," said Wang Fandi, whose son Wang Nan died from a bullet wound to his head. "She was in the establishment. If the military wanted her to perform, she had to go. What else could she do?"<br />
<br />
Wang was a teacher at the China Conservatory of Music when Peng had been sent there by the military to study singing in her 20s. Though he never taught her directly, Wang had known who she was and describes her as being modest, a talented folk singer and an outstanding student.<br />
<br />
"When I look back at history, I will look at it from other perspectives," Wang said. "Even if she had done something wrong, we shouldn’t make a fuss about it. What’s important is what happens in the future."<br><br>2013-03-28<br><br>http://www.caochangqing.com  （轉載請指明出處）</td></tr><tr><td align=left nowrap><br>
